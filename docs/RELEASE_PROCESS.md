## Rollback Procedure

### When to Rollback
- Critical bugs affecting users
- Major performance degradation
- Data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities introduced

### Rollback Steps

**Option 1: Git Revert (Preferred)**
```bash
# Revert to previous tag
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Tag rollback
git tag -a v1.2.0-rollback -m "Rollback release 1.2.0"
git push --tags

# Trigger deployment
```

**Option 2: Redeploy Previous Version**
```bash
# Checkout previous version
git checkout v1.1.0

# Deploy
npm run deploy:production
```

**Option 3: Kubernetes Rollback**
```bash
# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/user-service
kubectl rollout undo deployment/product-service

# Check status
kubectl rollout status deployment/user-service
```

**Database Rollback:**
```bash
# If migrations were run, rollback database
npm run migrate:down:production

# Or restore from backup
npm run db:restore:production --backup-id=<backup-id>
```

## Emergency Release

For critical hotfixes that can't wait for the regular cycle:

1. Follow [HOTFIX_GUIDE.md](./HOTFIX_GUIDE.md)
2. Skip staging if P0 severity
3. Fast-track approvals (1 senior dev)
4. Deploy immediately after testing
5. Monitor closely for 24 hours
6. Post-mortem within 48 hours
