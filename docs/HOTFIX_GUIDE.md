# Hotfix Guide

## When to Create a Hotfix

A hotfix is an emergency fix deployed outside the normal release cycle.

**Create a hotfix for:**
- ‚úÖ Production outages
- ‚úÖ Critical security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Data corruption issues
- ‚úÖ Payment processing failures
- ‚úÖ Complete feature breakage affecting all users

**Do NOT create a hotfix for:**
- ‚ùå Minor bugs affecting few users
- ‚ùå UI cosmetic issues
- ‚ùå Feature requests
- ‚ùå Performance optimizations
- ‚ùå Technical debt

---

## Severity Levels

| Level | Response | Examples | Process |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| **P0 - Critical** | < 1 hour | Complete outage, data loss, security breach | Immediate hotfix |
| **P1 - High** | < 4 hours | Major feature broken, payment issues | Same-day hotfix |
| **P2 - Medium** | < 24 hours | Minor bugs, partial feature broken | Next release |
| **P3 - Low** | Next sprint | UI issues, small bugs | Backlog |

---

## Hotfix Workflow

### Phase 1: Identification & Assessment (0-30 minutes)

#### 1.1 Identify the Issue
```bash
# Gather information:
# - What's broken?
# - When did it start?
# - How many users affected?
# - What's the business impact?

# Check monitoring:
# - Error rates
# - Response times
# - Database health
# - External service status
```

#### 1.2 Assess Severity
```bash
# Determine severity level
# P0: Immediate action required
# P1: Same-day fix needed
# P2: Can wait for next release

# If P0 or P1, proceed with hotfix
```

#### 1.3 Notify Team
```bash
# Post in #incidents Slack channel
# Alert on-call engineer
# Notify tech lead
# Update status page (if customer-facing)
```

**Incident Template:**
```markdown
üö® INCIDENT ALERT

**Severity:** P0 - Critical
**Service:** User Service
**Issue:** Authentication failures causing 500 errors
**Impact:** All users unable to log in
**Started:** 2025-01-15 10:30 AM EST
**Assigned:** @engineer-name
**Status:** Investigating
```

---

### Phase 2: Investigation & Fix (30 minutes - 2 hours)

#### 2.1 Create Hotfix Branch
```bash
# Create branch from main (current production code)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.2.1-ECOM-999-auth-failure

# Branch naming:
# hotfix/<new-version>-<ticket-id>-<short-description>
```

#### 2.2 Reproduce the Issue
```bash
# Reproduce locally or in staging
# Identify root cause
# Document findings in ticket
```

#### 2.3 Develop the Fix
**Guidelines:**
- Keep it MINIMAL - only fix the critical issue
- Don't add features or refactor
- Don't fix unrelated bugs
- Avoid large architectural changes
- Focus on correctness over perfection

```typescript
// Example: Fix authentication bug
// ‚ùå DON'T refactor everything
export class AuthService {
  // Refactor the entire class...
}

// ‚úÖ DO fix only the bug
export class AuthService {
  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    // Add null check that was missing
    if (!email || !password) {
      throw new Error('Email and password required');
    }
    // ... rest of existing code
  }
}
```

#### 2.4 Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Manual testing
# - Test the fix
# - Test related functionality
# - Test edge cases
# - Verify no regressions
```

#### 2.5 Commit with Clear Message
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve authentication failure in login endpoint

- Add null check for email and password parameters
- Return proper error message instead of 500
- Add unit tests for edge cases

Root Cause: Missing input validation allowed undefined values
to reach database query, causing server error.

Impact: All users unable to log in since deployment at 10:30 AM

Fixes ECOM-999"

git push origin hotfix/1.2.1-ECOM-999-auth-failure
```

---

### Phase 3: Review & Approval (30 minutes)

#### 3.1 Create Pull Request
```bash
# Create PR to main branch
# Use hotfix PR template
```

## Summary
Users unable to log in due to missing input validation in authentication endpoint.

## Timeline
- **10:30 AM** - Issue detected via monitoring alerts
- **10:35 AM** - Incident declared, team notified
- **10:45 AM** - Root cause identified
- **11:00 AM** - Fix developed and tested
- **11:10 AM** - Deployed to staging, verified
- **11:15 AM** - Deployed to production
- **11:20 AM** - Verified resolution
- **11:30 AM** - Incident closed

**Total Duration:** 60 minutes
**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes
**Time to Deploy:** 15 minutes

## Impact
- **Users Affected:** 100% (all users)
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Failed Login Attempts:** ~2,500
- **Revenue Impact:** ~$5,000 (estimated)
- **Customer Support Tickets:** 37

## Root Cause
Missing null/undefined check for email and password parameters allowed
invalid values to reach database query, causing uncaught exception.

## What Went Well
‚úÖ Quick detection (< 5 minutes after deployment)
‚úÖ Clear monitoring alerts
‚úÖ Fast root cause identification
‚úÖ Minimal fix scope
‚úÖ Quick deployment process
‚úÖ Good team communication

## What Went Wrong
‚ùå Missing test cases for edge cases
‚ùå No input validation in API layer
‚ùå Insufficient code review focus on validation
‚ùå Staging tests didn't catch the issue

## Action Items
1. **Immediate**
   - [ ] Add input validation middleware (Owner: @dev1, Due: 2025-01-16)
   - [ ] Add test cases for null/undefined inputs (Owner: @dev2, Due: 2025-01-16)

2. **Short-term (1 week)**
   - [ ] Audit all API endpoints for input validation (Owner: @dev3, Due: 2025-01-22)
   - [ ] Update code review checklist to emphasize validation (Owner: @tech-lead, Due: 2025-01-22)
   - [ ] Add automated validation tests to CI pipeline (Owner: @dev4, Due: 2025-01-22)

3. **Long-term (1 month)**
   - [ ] Implement API schema validation using Joi/Zod (Owner: @team, Due: 2025-02-15)
   - [ ] Add chaos engineering tests (Owner: @sre, Due: 2025-02-15)
   - [ ] Improve staging test coverage (Owner: @qa, Due: 2025-02-15)

## Prevention
- Enforce input validation at API gateway level
- Require schema validation for all endpoints
- Add property-based testing for edge cases
- Update developer training materials

## Lessons Learned
1. Input validation is critical and should be layered
2. Edge case testing prevents production issues
3. Quick detection and response minimized impact
4. Having a clear hotfix process saved time
```
